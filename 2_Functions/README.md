# Pixel Smile

Welcome to the Pixel Smile project! We've inherited a program from a colleague that's supposed to create pixel art, specifically a smiling face, and print it to the console. Unfortunately, the program is full of errors and doesn't work in its current state.

The challenge is to leverage TypeScriptâ€™s powerful type system to help us find and fix the bugs, and to guide our work in implementing the missing pieces of the program.

When we're done, we should see this lovely smiling face in our console:

```
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
X                  X
X      X    X      X
X                  X
X   X          X   X
X   XXXXXXXXXXXX   X
X                  X
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
