# Password Generator

Nearly every website and app requires a username and password to authenticate you as … you. It’s easy to use the same password for every login, however, it’s insecure. If someone finds your main password, they can log into all your accounts. You could solve this by creating a new password for every login, but creating new passwords is hard.

To make coming up with passwords a snap, you’ll create a password-generating program that generates passwords of any length, and even readable ones! — Use your knowledge of TypeScript class types to make logins better protected.
