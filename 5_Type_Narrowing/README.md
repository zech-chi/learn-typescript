# Park Service Volunteer Appreciation Program

The National Park Service has recently inherited two beautiful parks: **Wolf Point Park** and **Raccoon Meadows**. Each park has a dedicated team of volunteers who help with vital tasks like maintaining trails, cleaning campsites, and planning educational events.

To foster a sense of unity and recognize outstanding dedication, the Park Service wants to combine the volunteer programs and launch a new Volunteer Appreciation Program. The goal is to award a special edition park badge to the volunteers with the most hours logged across both parks.

A colleague has already started building a program to handle this, but it's incomplete. Your mission is to pick up where they left off, fix any issues, and complete the program. Get your bug spray and hiking boots readyâ€”it's time to combine some data and celebrate our top volunteers!

## Project Goal

The primary objective is to complete a program that processes volunteer data from two separate park logs, combines them, calculates the total hours for each volunteer, and identifies the individual(s) who will receive the top volunteer award.

## Core Tasks

*   **Combine Data:** Merge volunteer logs from Wolf Point Park and Raccoon Meadows into a single, unified dataset.
*   **Process Volunteer Hours:** Iterate through the combined data to calculate the total number of hours each unique volunteer has contributed.
*   **Identify Top Volunteers:** Analyze the calculated totals to determine which volunteer (or volunteers, in case of a tie) has logged the most hours.
*   **Display Results:** Print the results to the console, clearly announcing the winner(s) of the appreciation program.
