# Self Driving Car

Self-driving cars are set to be the next revolution in the automotive industry. The idea is simple: create a vehicle that can see the world and react to it as a human driver would. However, the implementation is fraught with complex challenges.

This project tasks you with creating a foundational program that allows a self-driving car to perceive and react to obstacles in its path. You’ll use your knowledge of TypeScript’s powerful object-oriented features to apply strict types to a variety of classes, properties, and methods.

Start your engine, and let's hit the road!

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to model a car's basic sensory and decision-making logic using TypeScript. You will define the structure of a `Car` and the different types of `Obstacles` it might encounter, then implement the methods needed for it to react appropriately.

The focus is on correctly applying TypeScript's type system to object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to build a reliable and error-free simulation.
