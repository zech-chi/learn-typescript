# Restaurant Orders

This project builds upon a restaurant recommender system to add exciting new functionality for both customers and restaurant managers. Instead of just recommending restaurants, we're now diving deeper to filter individual **orders** or dishes based on a customer's budget.

The goal is to help restaurant managers highlight their specials and allow customers to easily find dishes that fit their price range. This program focuses on using modern array methods, creating well-organized functions, and practicing good code hygiene to achieve the final result.

When complete, the program will take a budget and a list of restaurants with their menus, then print a clean, filtered list of affordable dishes.

## Final Output

The finished program will filter orders by a given price and print out the eligible orders and their prices, grouped by restaurant, like so:

```
Restaurant Name #1
- Order 1: $9.99
- Order 2: $8.99
Restaurant Name #2
- Order 1: $17.99
- Order 2: $15.99
```
