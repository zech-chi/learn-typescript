# TypeMart

Welcome to our new online shop: TypeMart! We’re ready to go live… well, almost… We’re attempting to get this shop up and going, and have recently coded a crucial piece of our online mart: the purchase flow!

It was really important to us that the purchase flow is type-safe. All that type safety will allow us to sleep well at night.

Currently, we are producing a few types of products, and we can’t wait to expand as we start to sell our first items. For our mart to be successful, we’ll have to calculate the correct price for shoppers, in addition to applying any specials or other charges.

This project focuses on creating a type-safe purchase flow for TypeMart visitors.

## Features

The following features have been implemented in the TypeMart purchase flow:

*   **Product Selection:** Users can select a product from our list of available items.
*   **Pre-Order Notifications:** If a product is on pre-order, the customer will receive a notification that they will be messaged when it ships.
*   **Dynamic Shipping Costs:** We offer free shipping on orders of $25 or more. For orders under $25, a flat shipping fee of $5 is applied.
*   **Tax Calculation:** Taxes are calculated based on the shipping address. A 10% tax is applied for orders shipped within New York, and a 5% tax is applied for all other locations.
*   **Receipt Generation:** A detailed receipt is generated for each order, including the product name, shipping address, price, taxes, shipping costs, and the total amount.
